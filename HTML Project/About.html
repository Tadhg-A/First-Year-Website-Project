<h3>We need your help</h3>
<p class="paragraph">

    The Vaquita Porpoise, one of the rarest marine mammals on Earth, faces imminent extinction, and your support can make a crucial difference.
    With only a handful remaining in the wild, the Vaquita is threatened by illegal fishing practices, specifically the use of gillnets to catch another endangered species, the totoaba fish.
    <br>
    <br>
    Tragically, Vaquitas often become unintentional victims of these nets.
    OceanPulse Preservation Fund is actively engaged in efforts to save the Vaquita through increased patrolling of their habitat, collaboration with local communities to promote sustainable fishing alternatives, and supporting the development of alternative fishing gear that minimizes harm to marine life.
<br>
<br>
 By donating to OceanPulse, you contribute to a lifeline for the Vaquita Porpoise and many other sea animals, helping to fund critical conservation initiatives that can turn the tide and ensure the survival of these unique and endangered species.
 Your support is not just a donation; it's an investment in the preservation of biodiversity and the delicate balance of our oceans.
